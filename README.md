# 🍪 CookInt - Where Numbers Meet Cookies! 

Ever wondered what would happen if numbers got hungry and turned into cookies? Well, wonder no more! CookInt is here to transform boring numbers into delicious cookie-themed strings!

## 🎮 What Can It Do?

This tasty little struct can munch on any number from 0 all the way up to `ulong.MaxValue` (that's a LOT of cookies!) and turn it into a cookie-themed string. It's like a bakery for your numbers! 

### 🧁 Cookie Recipe (Features)

- Turns regular numbers into cookie strings (yum!)
- Can handle numbers bigger than the cookies in your grandma's jar (`ulong.MaxValue`)
- Does all the math stuff (because cookies need to do math too!)
- Converts back and forth between boring numbers and delicious cookies
- Comes with a full set of comparison operators (to see which cookie is bigger!)

### 🥠 Cookie Operations

- Basic cookie math: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (sharing cookies is important!)
- Make cookies bigger or smaller: `++`, `--`
- Compare cookies: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Cookie bit-mixing: `&`, `|`, `^` (for the tech-savvy cookie monsters)

## 🍪 How Does It Bake? (How It Works)

Each cookie is made with our special recipe using these ingredients:
- c: c, C, č, Č (crunchy variations)
- o: o, O, ǒ, Ǒ (round and sweet)
- k: k, K, ǩ, Ǩ (krispy bits)
- i: i, I, ǐ, Ǐ (icing options)
- e: e, E, ě, Ě (extra toppings)

## 🎨 Cookie Gallery (Examples)

Here's how some numbers look when they turn into cookies:
```csharp
CookInt num = 1;     // Becomes: cookiE
CookInt num = 2;     // Becomes: cookiě
CookInt num = 3;     // Becomes: cookiĚ
CookInt num = 4;     // Becomes: cookIe
CookInt num = 5;     // Becomes: cookIE
```

## 🎯 How to Use Your Cookies

```csharp
// Bake a fresh cookie
CookInt number = 42;

// Mix some cookies together
CookInt result = number + 10;

// Turn your cookie back into a number (but why would you want to?)
ulong value = (ulong)result;

// Make your cookie bigger
number++;

// See which cookie is bigger
bool isGreater = number > 10;
```

## 🔧 Technical Cookie Ingredients

- Needs a .NET oven with UTF-8 support
- Uses special UTF-8 encoding for fancy cookie decorations
- Comes with all the mathematical toppings you could want

## 📝 Final Cookie Crumb

This is a fun way to represent numbers - because why should numbers be boring when they can be cookies? Perfect for when you want to add a sprinkle of fun to your code! 🍪✨

Remember: No actual cookies were harmed in the making of this number system! 🎉
